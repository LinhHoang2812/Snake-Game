# Snake-Game
Used Python to build snake game 
I use OPP to build this game
Scoreboard class keeps track of the score and highscore
Food class create random food on the screen
Snake class create snake body and control snake movements on the screen
Highscore.txt keeps record of the highest score of the player. In my case it is 31.
